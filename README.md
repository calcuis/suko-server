### code review
This Python code sets up a basic HTTP server using the http.server and socketserver modules, allowing you to serve files from a specified directory. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Importing Modules:
```
import http.server
import socketserver
```
These lines import the necessary modules for creating an HTTP server (http.server for the server itself and `socketserver` for handling the socket connections).

Setting Configuration Parameters:
```
directory = '.'
port = 8000
```
The directory variable is set to the current directory ('.'), and the port variable is set to 8000. You can change the directory to specify the location of the files you want to serve, and the port to set the server's listening port.

Defining the Request Handler:
```
Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
```
This line defines the request handler class to be used by the server. In this case, it uses `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`, which is a basic handler provided by http.server to handle GET requests and serve files.

Creating and Configuring the Server:

python
Copy code
with socketserver.TCPServer(("", port), Handler) as httpd:
This line creates a TCP server using the specified port and handler. The server is instantiated within a with statement to ensure proper cleanup after its use.

Printing Server Information:
```
print(f"Serving at http://localhost:{port}")
```
This line prints a message indicating the server is running and provides the URL where it can be accessed.

Opening the Browser:
```
import webbrowser
webbrowser.open(f'http://localhost:{port}')
```
This section uses the webbrowser module to automatically open a web browser and navigate to the specified URL, making it easy to access the server.

Starting the Server:
```
httpd.serve_forever()
```
This line starts the server and makes it run indefinitely (`serve_forever()`). The server will continue to handle incoming requests until manually stopped.

In summary, this Python script sets up a basic HTTP server, serves files from the current directory, and automatically opens a web browser to access the server at `localhost:8000`.
